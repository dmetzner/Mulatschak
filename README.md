# Mulatschak

Mulatschak is a card game from Austria. 
First you must bid on how many tricks(Stiche) you can achieve and then you have to try to make them. Play against up to 3 opponents. 
How many stitches do you dare to bid? Are you able to win enough stitches, or even more? 
If so, then your points go down. Whoever gets first down to 0 points wins.
A mulatschak, in other words, winning all the tricks of a round on announcement, might be helpful!
